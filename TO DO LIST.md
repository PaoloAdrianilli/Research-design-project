TO DO LIST: (for now)

any weight required?;
merge all the dataset and generate the actual dataset --->there is an error in the merging procedure per se

recode through loops all the time variant variables (wormi and many others are already done)

give labels to values and variables (stata doesn't do that when merging). VALUES OF WO* are not all labeled 

in general > recode variables (missing and no answer)



Later > also do all the desrciptives, but first the above
