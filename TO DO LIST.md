TO DO LIST: (for now)

any weight required?;
merge all the dataset and generate the actual dataset --->there is an error in the merging procedure per se

recode through loops all the time variant variables (wormi already done)

give labels to values and variables (stata doesn't do that when merging)

in general > recode variables (missing and no answer)



Later > also do all the desrciptives, but first the above
