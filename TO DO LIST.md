TO DO LIST:

double check variables;
1:1 is the good way to merge the "additional" datasets?; 
Row 280, what to do about that?;
merge all the dataset and generate the actual dataset ---> I tried to merge but several variables were considered as inexistent, why? moroever there is an error in the merging procedure per se. pid is not(I don't know why) considered as a good key variable
