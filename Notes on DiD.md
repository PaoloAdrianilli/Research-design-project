Event: Using Difference-in-Differences to Measure Political Effects: Evidence from the Catalonian independence process

We use DiD when we do not have experimental data (randomly selected observations).

-Challenges for causal inference:
•we have confounders
•unobserved variables
•self selection: e.g. treatment: see a electoral campaing; outcome: to vote. Positive association... But, more politically active people will be self-selected within the group of people exposed to the treatment. 
•reverse causality (I don't think it is a problem that affect our work)

Main pro of DiD: it controls for unobserved time-invariant variables (sex, year of birth, PSES...). However it does not account for time-varying confounders that affect the tratment group
Main assumption: PTA (parralel trends assumption), To TEST IT WE CAN OBSERVE TIME PREVIOUS TREATMENT. if PTA is violated DiD could be bias.
It is worth to note that "spillover effects" exist. When the treatment affects also the control group.


How to to DiD
STEP1: define treatment and control groups
STEP2: measure pre-treatment and post-treatment outcomes
STEP3: calculate the differences
STEP4

It would be nice to add a chronology of the events in our research. What about external validity?
